# Hi, I'm Brian <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="35px">

I am the Sr. Manager of DevRel at NetApp Instaclustr.

I've always enjoyed writing code and finally seeing it work. The euphoric feeling of completing a project that had been extremely frustrating to figure out. It's time to share these publicly! Want to find me on Social? [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thebriangraf).

I also have a deep passion for collaborations, contributing to open sources, and community engagements.

You can find me here ðŸ‘‡
